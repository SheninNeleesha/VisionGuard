Results For Path Assistance Module 
As shown in the serial monitor, when an object was placed in front of the sensor the sensor reading measured displayed a shorter distance and based on this the user will receive a haptic feed back with higher vibration intensity.  (Sensor maximum set distance was 2m)

Estimated Accuracy: ~100% functional accuracy in controlled testing, as no failure or misfire was reported during testing. 

Results For Object Detection Module 
Camera will capture a frame and all object present within the frame will be processed. Bounding boxes will be produced for each and every  object and centerpoints will be obtained using the bouding boxes. Based on the centerpoints the object closest to the hand of the user will be detected and will be give out as a audio ce to the user.

Estimated Accuracy: Based on bounding box alignment and feedback confirmation, we can confidently estimate:

Object detection precision: ~92–95%
Audio cue generation success rate: ~90–95%
Overall object detection module accuracy: ~93%
